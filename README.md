This repository contains a pristine boilerplate with recommended settings for a new electron application. It is intended to 
be forked and used as a starting point for new applications. Any tweaks to configuration can then be pulled from upstream if required.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Fork the repository
* Run 'yarn start' to run the project in your new repo.
* From that point on you may build out the application you need.

### Helpful electron concepts ###

* Online/Offline Event Detection: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/online-offline-events
* Updating Applications:          https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/updates
* Packaging:                      https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/forge-overview

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Ensure any changes are very targeted and do not affect the boilerplate too much. (Consider the impact on other projects that may be using this boilerplate.)
